 OOPs in Java Cheats
=====================

1. Class & Object:
A class is a blueprint. An object is an instance of a class.

2. Access Specifiers:
public, private, protected, default

3. Encapsulation:
Binding data and methods in a single unit (class) using private variables and public methods.

4. Constructor:
Special method with same name as class, no return type, used to initialize objects.

5. this Pointer:
"this" refers to the current object.

6. Copy Constructor:
Java does not have built-in copy constructors, but can be implemented manually.

7. Shallow vs Deep Copy:
Shallow copy shares object references. Deep copy creates independent copies.

8. Destructor:
Java uses Garbage Collection, no explicit destructors. finalize() method deprecated.

9. Inheritance:
Using "extends" keyword. Enables reuse of code.

10. Mode of Inheritance:
Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical (Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes).

11. Types of Inheritance:
- Single
- Multilevel
- Hierarchical
- Multiple (via Interfaces)

12. Polymorphism:
Compile-time (method overloading) and Runtime (method overriding).

13. Function Overloading:
Multiple methods with same name but different parameters.

14. Function Overriding:
Child class provides specific implementation of a parent class method.

15. Virtual Function:
All non-static, non-final methods are virtual by default.

16. Abstraction:
Hiding internal details using abstract classes or interfaces.

17. Abstract Class:
Cannot be instantiated. Can have abstract and non-abstract methods.

18. Static Keyword:
Used for variables, methods, blocks, nested classes shared by all instances.
