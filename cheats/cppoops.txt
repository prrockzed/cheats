====================
 OOPs in C++ Cheats
====================

  1. Class & Object:
  Core building block. Class defines, Object uses.

  2. Access Specifiers:
  public, private, protected

  3. Encapsulation:
  Use of private members and public getters/setters.

  4. Constructor:
  Same name as class, no return type.

  5. this Pointer:
  Pointer to current object instance inside class method.

  6. Copy Constructor:
  Special constructor to initialize a new object from an existing one.

  7. Shallow vs Deep Copy:
  Shallow copies references; Deep copies full object memory.

  8. Destructor:
  ~ClassName() - Cleans up resources.

  9. Inheritance:
  class Derived : access_modifier Base {};

  10. Mode of Inheritance:
  public, protected, private

  11. Types of Inheritance:
  Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid

  12. Polymorphism:
  Compile-time (overloading), Runtime (virtual functions)

  13. Function Overloading:
  Same function name, different parameters

  14. Function Overriding:
  Derived class provides new definition of base class virtual function.

  15. Virtual Function:
  Keyword "virtual" allows method to be overridden.

  16. Abstraction:
  Hiding complexity via abstract classes (at least one pure virtual function).

  17. Abstract Class:
  class A { virtual void func() = 0; };

  18. Static Keyword:
  Used for members shared across instances.
